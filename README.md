# battleship game
Main Concepts: Data structures, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Recursion, and OOP 
-----
General: This project focused on developing a working battleship game. Writing helper functions, deciding what kind of design or approach for the program, and choosing the right data structures helped save time and improved the flow of the program. After developing the setup so that a game can be created between two players, AI (Artifical Intelligence) was written (a bad, mediocre, and good player), with varying ranges of playstyle and level of decision making. This also relied on working knowledge of inheritance, polymorphism, recursion, and data structures in the full implementation.
